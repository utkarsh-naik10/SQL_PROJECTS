## ðŸ’¡ Insights

- **Mantys (India)** offers the **highest average salary** for a Data Analyst at **$650,000**, far above other companies.  
- **Top-paying U.S. companies** include **Meta**, **AT&T**, and **Pinterest**, offering salaries between **$230Kâ€“$330K**.  
- Most roles are **Full-time** and **Remote/Hybrid**, showing flexibility even for high-salary positions.  
- **Director** and **Principal** titles are common â€” higher seniority clearly correlates with higher pay.  
- **U.S. companies dominate** top-paying roles, but **Indiaâ€™s Mantys** appears as an outlier with an exceptionally high figure (possibly due to reporting or conversion differences).  

ðŸ“ˆ *Overall Insight:*  
Senior-level data roles (Directors, Principals) pay the most, often offering flexibility and leadership responsibilities. These jobs mix management with deep analytical expertise.
