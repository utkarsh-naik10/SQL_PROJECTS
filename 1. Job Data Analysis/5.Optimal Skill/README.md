- **R**, **Tableau**, and **Power BI** show strong balance â€” combining visualization and analytics value.  
- Cloud and modern tools like **Snowflake ($112K)** and **Azure ($110K)** command high pay but appear less frequently, indicating theyâ€™re specialized, high-value skills.  
- Legacy yet reliable tools such as **Excel** and **PowerPoint** still appear in listings, though with lower salary ranges.

## ðŸ“ˆ **Overall Insight**

- **Best Overall Skills to Learn:** SQL, Python, and Tableau â€” these consistently appear across high-salary and high-demand roles.  
- **High-Value Additions:** Cloud and BI tools like Snowflake, Azure, and Looker significantly increase earning potential.  
- A combination of **data handling (SQL, Python)** + **reporting (Tableau, Power BI)** + **cloud integration (Azure, Snowflake)** makes for an optimal, future-proof skill set.
