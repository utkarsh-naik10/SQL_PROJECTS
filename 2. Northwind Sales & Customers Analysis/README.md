## Northwind SQL Analysis â€“ SQL Portfolio Project  
---

## Overview  
This project explores the **Northwind Traders Database**, a classic dataset used for learning relational databases.  
The goal is to answer **20 business-relevant questions** across four categories:  
- Basic SQL Queries  
- Joins & Aggregations  
- Business Insights  
- Advanced Analysis  

Each query is stored in its own folder with:  
- `query.sql` â€“ the SQL code  
- `README.md` â€“ explanation of the question, approach, and insights  
- `output.png` â€“ (optional) screenshot of the results
