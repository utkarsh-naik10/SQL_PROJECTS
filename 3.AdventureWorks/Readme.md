# AdventureWorks SQL Analysis

This folder contains a complete SQL analysis project built on the **AdventureWorks** database.  
Across multiple sections, the project covers customer behavior, employee performance, product insights, profitability, and long-term trends.  
All analysis was done using **SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS)**, and each section includes the SQL scripts along with result snapshots from SSMS.

The goal of this project is to understand different aspects of the AdventureWorks business using SQL alone, without external tools.
