# 📂 SQL Projects Portfolio

Welcome to my SQL portfolio!  
This repository contains a collection of projects that demonstrate my ability to use **SQL for data analysis, business insights, and problem solving**.  

Each project is self-contained with:
- A clear **problem statement**  
- The **SQL queries** used to solve it  
- An explanation of the **approach & insights**  
- **Result screenshots** or tables
